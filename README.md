# Design Patterns
Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems.
I have included implementations of some design patterns in C# to help beginners like me get their feet wet.
There are better alternatives available for some of them in the .NET Framework, so this is by no means a comprehensive tutorial.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome. If you want to add a new design pattern implementation, just follow the naming convention, fork my repo and submit a pull request. Same goes for any improvements and modifications.

## Types of Design Patterns
---------------------------
There are three kinds of Design Patterns:

* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

## Install requirements
To install missing framework, download:
### for MacOS X
https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.NETCore.App&framework_version=2.1.0&arch=x64&rid=osx.10.15-x64
### for all platforms
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/dotnet/2.1/runtime?cid=getdotnetcore

## How to run 
`cd` to a certain pattern sub-folder, and `dotnet run`. Or, you can use `batch_dotnet_run.sh` directly.
